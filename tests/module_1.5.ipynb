The cinematography was breathtaking, especially the long shots of the desert landscapes which felt almost like a National Geographic documentary. Every frame was a painting, though I must admit the first act felt a bit sluggish and could have used more tight editing to keep the pace going.\",\n",
    "        \"What really struck me was the lead actor's performance. It wasn't just about the dialogue; his subtle facial expressions conveyed more emotion than a ten-page script ever could. However, the supporting cast felt a bit wooden in comparison, and there were moments where the background music was so loud it almost drowned out the crucial conversation in the final scene of the second act.\",\n",
    "        \"The plot explores some very deep philosophical themes about time and memory, which is rare for a big-budget blockbuster these days. It reminded me a lot of Inception or Memento, requiring the audience to actually pay attention to the clues scattered throughout. Some people might find it confusing, but for those who enjoy a mental challenge, this movie is a absolute treasure trove of ideas.\",\n",
    "        \"Technically, the film is a triumph. The sound design and the practical effects—thank god they didn't over-rely on CGI—created an immersive atmosphere that stayed with me long after I left the cinema. Even though the ending felt a little rushed and left a few plot holes unplugged, the overall experience was powerful enough that I would recommend it to anyone looking for serious sci-fi.\"\n",
